Subject: [PATCH 0/3] drivers/auxdisplay: Provide support for JHD1313

The JHD1313 is a 16x2 LCD controller with an I2C interface. It is used in the
Seeed RGB Backlight LCD [0] which has the LCD at the I2C address 0x3e. (A
PCA9633 is also available at 0x62, to control the RGB backlight)

This series introduces a new Vendor prefix for JHD, and introduces bindings for
the LCD controller. A driver for the JHD1313 is added to the auxdisplay
subsystem providing a charlcd to control the display.

Because this interface is quite common, and generic - this could be potentially
extended to other similar devices later, possibly with optional bindings to
configure the display width and height. If so - perhaps a more generic naming
for the binding/driver might be appropriate at that time.
